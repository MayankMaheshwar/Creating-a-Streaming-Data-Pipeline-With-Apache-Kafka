You'll create another SSH connection to the VM. In the Console, open the Navigation Menu and select Compute Engine > VM Instances. Next to the VM name kafka-1-kafka-vm-1, click the SSH button to connect to the Kafka VM. (This will be SSH Window B)

Now, execute the following command to run the WordCount demo application. You can safely ignore any warn log messages.

kafka-run-class.sh org.apache.kafka.streams.examples.wordcount.WordCountDemo
The WordCount demo application will read from the input topic streams-plaintext-input, perform the computations of the WordCount algorithm on the input data, and continuously write its current results to the output topic streams-wordcount-output (the names of its input and output topics are hardcoded). You can terminate the demo at any point by entering Ctrl-C from the keyboard.
