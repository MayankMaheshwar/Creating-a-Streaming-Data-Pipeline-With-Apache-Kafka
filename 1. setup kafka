In the Cloud Console, open the Navigation menu and click Marketplace.

Locate the Apache KafkaÂ® deployment by searching for Kafka Click to Deploy.

Click on Kafka Cluster (with replication). It should look like this:



Configure the Kafka VM instance
In the Console, open the Navigation Menu and select Compute Engine > VM Instances. Next to the VM name kafka-1-kafka-vm-0, click the SSH button to connect to the Kafka VM. (This will be SSH Window A)


export PROJECT_ID=$(gcloud config get-value project)

Copy the generated jar file from the storage bucket to the Kafka VM and create the destination sub-directory for the Kafka connector:

gsutil cp gs://cloud-training/gsp285/binary/cps-kafka-connector.jar .
sudo mkdir -p /opt/kafka/connectors
Move the downloaded jar file to the directory created for the Kafka application and update the java connector file permissions to be executable:

sudo mv ./cps-kafka-connector.jar /opt/kafka/connectors/
sudo chmod +x /opt/kafka/connectors/cps-kafka-connector.jar
Change the current directory to /opt/kafka/config and use an editor create cps-sink-connector.properties.

cd /opt/kafka/config
sudo nano cps-sink-connector.properties
Add the following content to the file:

name=CPSSinkConnector
connector.class=com.google.pubsub.kafka.sink.CloudPubSubSinkConnector
tasks.max=10
topics=to-pubsub
cps.topic=from-kafka
cps.project=$PROJECT_ID
After adding the content, press Ctrl-O and Enter to save the changes, then Ctrl-X to exit.

Using an editor create another file named cps-source-connector.properties.

sudo nano cps-source-connector.properties
Add the following content to the file:

name=CPSSourceConnector
connector.class=com.google.pubsub.kafka.source.CloudPubSubSourceConnector
tasks.max=10
kafka.topic=from-pubsub
cps.subscription=to-kafka-sub
cps.project=$PROJECT_ID
Again, press Ctrl-O and Enter to save the changes, then Ctrl-X to exit.
